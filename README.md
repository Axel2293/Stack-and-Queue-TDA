# Stack-and-Queue-TDA
Stack and Queue containers for generic data, full implementation is available and also its constructed on a TDA structure.

## STACK
Uses LIFO (Last in - First out) structure to offer push and pop operations.
Requirements:
- Creating the stack needs the size of the data that youre going to store, for example use sizeof(double) in the stackCreate() as an argument so the stack knows how much data its gona be storing.

## QUEUE
Uses FIFO (Firs in - First out) structure to offer enqueue and dequeue operations.
Requirements:
- Creating the Queue needs the size of the data that youre going to store (same as stack), for example use sizeof(double) in the queueCreate() as an argument so the stack knows how much data its gona be storing.
